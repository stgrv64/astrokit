irrecord -  application for recording IR-codes for usage with lirc

This program will record the signals from your remote control
and create a config file for lircd.


A proper config file for lircd is maybe the most vital part of this
package, so you should invest some time to create a working config
file. Although I put a good deal of effort in this program it is often
not possible to automatically recognize all features of a remote
control. Often short-comings of the receiver hardware make it nearly
impossible. If you have problems to create a config file check the wiki
at https://sourceforge.net/p/lirc-remotes/wiki, the Checklist and the
manual page.
If there already is a remote control of the same brand available at
http://www.lirc.org/remotes/ you might also want to try using such a
remote as a template. The config files already contain all
parameters of the protocol used by remotes of a certain brand and
knowing these parameters makes the job of this program much
easier. There are also template files for the most common protocols
available in the remotes/generic/ directory of the source
distribution of this package. You can use a template files by
providing the path of the file as command line parameter.

Please take the time to finish this file as described in
https://sourceforge.net/p/lirc-remotes/wiki/Checklist/
and make it available to others by sending it to 
<lirc@bartelmus.de>

Press RETURN to continue.
Now start pressing buttons on your remote control.

It is very important that you press many different buttons and hold them
down for approximately one second. Each button should generate at least one
dot but in no case more than ten dots of output.
Don't stop pressing buttons until two lines of dots (2x80) have been
generated.

Press RETURN now to start recording.
